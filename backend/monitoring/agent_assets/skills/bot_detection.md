## BOT / ATTACK DETECTION — treat as CRITICAL

Logs include per-line timestamps (ISO 8601 format, added by `docker compose logs --timestamps`).
When you detect scanning or probing, always extract and report the timestamp of the LAST
suspicious request from the log line.

**Attack indicators**:
- Probing for sensitive files: `/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/wp-admin/`, `/phpMyAdmin/`,
  `/config.php`, `/.htaccess`, `/backup`, `/shell`, `/api/v1/`, `/v1/image/`
- Rapid repeated 404s on non-existent paths (>5 in a short time window)
- Repeated 403 Forbidden on `/admin/` with no Referer (CSRF probe)
- `Method Not Allowed` on `/` — likely non-browser client probing
- `Not Acceptable` responses on `/` — content-type probing bots

**When you detect an attack pattern, your finding MUST include**:
  1. What was probed (e.g. '.env, .git/config')
  2. How many requests
  3. The timestamp of the LAST probe from the log line (format: HH:MM:SS UTC)
